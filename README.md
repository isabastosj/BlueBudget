# BlueBudget

**Stay organized, stay on budget.**

BlueBudget is a simple shopping organization app that allows users to create multiple shopping lists. You can add items, quantities, and prices as you shop. The total is automatically calculated by multiplying the quantity by the price and summing the values of all items.

## About the Project

BlueBudget was created with the goal of simplifying the shopping process. Instead of using multiple apps to create lists and track prices, BlueBudget brings everything into one place, helping users organize and track their expenses without forgetting any essential items. The tool makes it easy to create shopping lists and add items with their quantities and prices, providing a clear overview of the total budget.

## Results

I am happy with the project's progress. It is the fourth version of the same app, and each version has been an opportunity to learn and improve. With every iteration, the app becomes more efficient and useful for anyone who wants to organize their shopping in a practical way.


## Research

Through research and user needs, I found that many people face difficulties in efficiently organizing their shopping. This inspired me to create BlueBudget as a practical and accessible solution to this problem.

## Reflections

Creating BlueBudget allowed me to learn a lot of new things. I know the app can still improve, but I'm happy with the final result. I will likely continue to review and enhance the app whenever new ideas or needs arise. Even though itâ€™s a simple project, it provided me with valuable learning experiences and skills.
